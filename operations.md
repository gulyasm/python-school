# Operations 
In this section we will learn how to run, operate python applications.

## Where can I run Python code?
- _Python console_
Interactive REPL to run python. No autocomplete, backspace handling is bad.
- _Python command line_
Most python application is written as `.py` files and can be run via `python main.py`
- _Ipython console_
A better console with autocomplete, normal backspace handling.
- _Ipython notebook
UI to iterate, experiment with python. HTML can display graphs.
- _virtualenv_
To evade version (dependency) hell use virtualenv, containers. It creates a new isolated environment with only our dependencies.

## Python version
Use python3 until you are forced to use 2.7. Some library still does not support python 3.
Main difference print function and UTF-8 support.
